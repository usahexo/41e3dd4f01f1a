#  Ski Country is also Ski Betting Country

 Skiing is big business, as evidenced by the proliferation of high-end resorts across North America and Europe. And with that business comes a healthy side industry in betting on skiing competitions.

For those who are new to the concept, ski betting is simply wagering on the outcome of a downhill or slalom race. Traditionally, bets are placed on either individuals or teams, with odds being set based on past performances and current form.

Given the inherent danger involved in alpine skiing, predicting the outcome of a race can be a risky proposition. That said, there are plenty of shrewd observers who make a living (or just have some fun) betting on skiing events.

If you're looking to get in on the action, here are three tips to help you make smarter ski bets:

1. Look at recent results – One of the best ways to gauge an athlete's form is to look at their recent results. Has the skier been winning races consistently? Or have they been crashing more often than usual? This information will give you a good idea of how likely they are to win upcoming races.

2. Check the odds – As with any other type of gambling, it's important to shop around for the best odds when betting on skiing competitions. Some books offer better odds than others, so it pays to do your homework before placing a bet.

3. Follow the experts – There are plenty of knowledgeable people out there who can help you make informed ski bets. Whether it's reading online handicapping columns or talking to friends who know their stuff, it's always wise to get as much information as possible before making a wager.
