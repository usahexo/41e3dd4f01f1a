#  Olympiacos Win Despite Odds 2.5 To 1

In any other season, Olympiacos would have been considered the underdogs when they faced AEK Athens on their home turf. However, after a slow start to the season, Olympiacos has turned it around and come into this matchup as the favorites.

The odds were on their side as they won 2-1, despite being at a disadvantage for most of the match. This was thanks to two goals in the last fifteen minutes of play by Rafik Djebbour and Andreas Bouchalakis.

This victory is a big step forward for Olympiacos, who are now in third place in the Greek league with 23 points. They are still behind leaders Panathinaikos and PAOK Salonika, but this win gives them hope that they can catch up and win the championship this year.

Olympiacos has had an up-and-down season so far, with some impressive wins and some disappointing losses. Their victory over AEK Athens is a good sign that they are starting to find their rhythm and play like a team that is capable of winning championships.

Rafik Djebbour has been a big part of this turnaround for Olympiacos. The Algerian striker joined the club in January and has already scored six goals in just nine appearances. With Djebbour leading the attack, Olympiacos has become a much more dangerous team.

Andreas Bouchalakis has also been playing well lately. The Greek midfielder scored his first goal of the season against AEK Athens and helped control the midfield throughout the match. If Bouchalakis can continue to play at this level, he will be a major asset for Olympiacos as they try to win trophies this year.

# 3. Olympiacos defy the odds to make it through to the next stage of the Champions League

In their final group game of the Champions League, Olympiacos defied all expectations by managing to beat Spanish side Atletico Madrid 3-1 and seal their spot in the next stage of the competition. It was a sensational result for the Greek side, who had been written off by many going into the game, with some pundits predicting an easy win for Atletico.

However, Olympiacos started brightly and took an early lead through Miguel Angel Guerrero. They then doubled their advantage shortly before halftime when Kostas Fortounis converted from the penalty spot. This left Atletico with a mountain to climb in the second half, and they pulled one back through Antoine Griezmann midway through the second period. However, Olympiacos held on to take the victory and progress to the next round.

It was a hugely impressive performance from Olympiacos, who showed great resilience and fighting spirit to come back from a goal down and seal an unlikely victory. They will now be looking to make further progress in the competition, and they will have every chance of doing so if they continue to play with this level of intensity and determination.

# 4. What do the odds mean in sports betting? Find out here 

A lot of people enjoy sports betting but may not understand all the terminology used. This can include the odds, which often confuse people. The odds are a way of expressing how likely it is that an event will happen. They are usually represented as a number, and this number is always between 0 and 1.

The odds are always against you when you bet on something. This is because the casino or bookmaker has to make money, and they do this by setting odds that mean they will make money whatever happens. So, if you bet $10 on one outcome and it wins, the casino will only pay you back $9 plus your original stake. If you bet on the other outcome, you will lose your entire stake of $10.

The odds on an event show how likely it is to happen, compared to something else. For example, if there is a 50% chance of something happening, then the odds would be 1:1 (or even money). This means that for every dollar you stake on this outcome, you will get back your dollar plus another dollar. If the odds are 2:1 then for every dollar you stake you will get back two dollars plus your original dollar.

The higher the odds against an event happening, the more likely it is that it won't happen. So, for example, if there is a 90% chance of something happening, then the odds would be 10:1. This means that for every ten dollars you stake on this outcome, you will only get back one dollar plus your original ten dollars.

# 5. Olympiacos stuns Borussia Dortmund with a victory against all odds

The Greek giant Olympiacos Piraeus pulled off one of the biggest upsets in recent Champions League history on Wednesday, stunning Dortmund with a 2-1 victory achieved against all odds.

Dortmund, who had arrived as heavy favorites, were taken by surprise right from the start and found themselves trailing 0-2 after just 27 minutes. Olympiacosâ€™ Danish striker Andreas Samaris opened the scoring in the 14th minute with a header from 12 yards out and Konstantinos Fortounis doubled the lead with a cool finish in the 27th minute.

Borussia Dortmund reduced the arrears just before halftime through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang but were unable to find an equalizer in the second half, despite creating numerous chances.

With this win, Olympiacos climbed to second place in Group F with four points from two games, while Dortmund are third with three points. Arsenal lead the group with six points after winning their opening two fixtures.
