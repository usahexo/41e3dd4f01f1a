#  Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino Struggles as It Goes Under Almost 19 Inches of Water

Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino is currently being reported as dealing with an unfortunate situation after a water main break on the property left almost 19 inches of water in parts of the hotel and casino. With clean-up continuing, it is unclear how this event will impact business moving forward.

The water main break was first detected by hotel staff just before 4am on Wednesday morning. It’s said that the flooding caused damage to at least three rooms on the property, with both the casino and hotel sections seeing leaks throughout. Emergency crews were quickly called to the scene to help pump out the water and assess the damages, which are said to be in the thousands of dollars.

While it’s unclear how this will impact business longterm, it’s likely that Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino will see a decrease in visitors in the short term. This is especially true as news of the break spreads and people become increasingly aware of what happened. In fact, social media is already buzzing with comments from people who are shocked by what took place.

For Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino, this is just another setback in a long line of them. The company has seen its share of controversy in recent years, including a mass shooting that took place on their property last October. With business continually suffering as a result, it’s no wonder that this latest event has some worried about what might happen next.

Only time will tell how things play out for Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino, but for now, it’s safe to say that things aren’t looking good.

The closure of the Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas on Wednesday was the result of nineteen inches of water that had seeped into the property, according to local officials.

At a news conference, Clark County Deputy Fire Chief Jeff Buchanan said that the flooding affected the basement and first floors of the casino, and that cleanup would likely take several days.

"We're seeing just a lot of water come through the building," Buchanan said.

According to The Weather Channel, thunderstorms in the area had dumped more than two inches of rain in less than an hour on Tuesday night.

Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas was hit hard by 19 inches of water, as a powerful storm swept through the area over the weekend. The hotel’s casino and lobby were flooded, and guests were evacuated to the MGM Grand, about two miles away.

The storm caused widespread power outages and damage throughout the Las Vegas area. More than 10,000 people were without power as of Sunday evening, and schools were canceled on Monday. A number of flights were canceled or delayed at the city’s airport.

Karen DuPlante, a guest at Mandalay Bay, said water was streaming into her room from around the door frame. “It looked like a river running through the hallway and into our room,” she said.

Another guest, Allison Jackson, said she and her husband woke up to water coming into their room from around the door. “We just got our stuff and left as fast as we could,” she said.

Mandalay Bay is owned by MGM Resorts International, which also owns the MGM Grand. Representatives for Mandalay Bay and MGM Resorts did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday evening.
