#  Bayern Munich gearing up for title defence with new signings and revamped squad 

After Carlo Ancelotti’s dismissal, Bayern Munich have been busy in the transfer market as they gear up for the new Bundesliga season. They have signed Colombian international James Rodriguez from Real Madrid on a two-year loan deal, with an option to buy him at the end of the season.

They have also brought in French youngster Kingsley Coman from Juventus on a permanent deal, and German international Sebastian Rudy from Hoffenheim. These signings are in addition to the arrival of Corentin Tolisso from Lyon.

The departures include Douglas Costa (Juventus), Arturo Vidal (Barcelona) and Philipp Lahm (retired). Niko Kovac has taken over as coach and he is looking to assemble a squad that can defend their title and also compete in the Champions League.

Bayern Munich had a disappointing season by their standards last year. They were knocked out of the Champions League at the semifinal stage by Real Madrid, and then lost to Borussia Dortmund in the DFB-Pokal final. This led to the dismissal of Ancelotti, and Kovac has been brought in to try and turn things around.

Rodriguez is a very good signing for Bayern Munich. He is a creative midfielder who can score goals and create chances for his team-mates. He will be a key player for them this season, and they will be hoping that he can help them win some silverware.

Coman is another young player who is highly rated by French pundits. He is an explosive winger who is good on the ball and can score goals. He will be a valuable addition to Bayern Munich’s squad, and he could be one of their stars this season.

Rudy is also an excellent signing for Bayern Munich. He is a hardworking midfielder who can play in several positions in midfield. He will provide competition for places in midfield, which will make Bayern Munich stronger heading into the new season.

#  Dortmund looking to bounce back after poor season with some new faces of their own 

Dortmund are coming into the new season with a lot to prove. Last season was not good for them by any means, as they narrowly avoided relegation. This season they have made some big changes, signing some new players in an attempt to bounce back.

One of their biggest signings has been Paco Alcacer from Barcelona. Alcacer is a very talented player, and Dortmund will be hoping he can replicate his goalscoring form from his time at Valencia. They have also signed Mahmoud Dahoud from Borussia Monchengladbach and Axel Witsel from Tianjin Quanjian. Both of these players are very experienced and should be able to help Dortmund improve on their sixth-place finish from last season.

It will not be easy for Dortmund to bounce back this season though. Bayern Munich continue to be the dominant force in German football, and it will be difficult for any other team to challenge them. However, with the new signings that Dortmund have made, they are certainly capable of finishing in the top four this season and returning to European competition.

#  Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig set to battle it out for Champions League football 

It has been an incredible season in the Bundesliga, with Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig battling it out for Champions League football.

Hoffenheim started the season well, but they have faded in recent months. They currently sit in fourth place, but they could easily drop down to fifth or even sixth if they lose their final two games.

RB Leipzig have been the surprise package of the season. They started poorly, but they have picked up a number of impressive victories in recent months. They currently sit in second place, and they have a real chance of securing Champions League football next season.

Both Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig will be determined to win their final two games. Hoffenheim face Werder Bremen and Bayern Munich, while RB Leipzig take on Hertha Berlin and Eintracht Frankfurt. It is going to be an exciting finish to the season!

#  Schalke 04 hoping new coach can help them return to the top 4 

Schalke 04 have been one of the most inconsistent teams in the Bundesliga over the past few seasons. They have failed to make it into the top 4 since 2014, and they are hoping that their new coach can help them return to their former glory.

Domenico Tedesco has been appointed as the new head coach of Schalke 04, and he is looking to bring in some new tactics and formations that can help them improve their performances. Schalke 04 have a talented squad, and they will be hoping to compete for the title this season.

Some of the main players that Tedesco will be relying on include:

- Julian Draxler: The German international is a very creative player, and he will be looking to create chances for his teammates this season.

- Max Meyer: Meyer is a very versatile player, and he will be looking to score some goals for Schalke 04 this season.

- Leon Goretzka: Goretzka is a very good midfielder, and he will be looking to provide some assists for his teammates this season.

#  Europa League contenders Bayer Leverkusen look to strengthen squad

The Europa League may not be the biggest or most prestigious club competition in the world, but for Bayer Leverkusen it represents a fantastic opportunity to win some silverware and secure Champions League qualification.

Peter Bosz’s side have been very impressive in the Bundesliga this season, but they know that they need to strengthen their squad if they are to compete on two fronts.

There have been reports that Bayer are interested in signing Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata, and this would be a great signing for the club.

Morata is a proven goalscorer at the highest level, and he would be an excellent addition to the Bayer squad.
