#  What is the SV88?

The SV88 is a semi-automatic rifle designed and manufactured in the United States by I.O. Incorporated. It is based on the AR-15 platform, and shares many of its features, including interchangeable parts and magazines. The SV88 differs from the AR-15 in that it is chambered for the .308 Winchester cartridge, instead of the more common .223 Remington cartridge. This makes the SV88 a more powerful rifle, with better ballistics and longer range than the AR-15.

The SV88 has seen limited distribution in the civilian market, but has found favor with law enforcement and military users due to its combination of firepower and accuracy. It has also been adopted by competitive shooters for use in 3-Gun matches, where its long range and high capacity make it a formidable opponent.

While it may not be as well known as some of the more popular rifles on the market, the SV88 is a highly capable weapon that deserves consideration for anyone looking for a serious firearm.
