#  Casino offers perfect game of blackjack!

Casinos offer perfect game of blackjack where players have the opportunity to win a lot of money. The game is thrilling and can be very exciting, especially when you hit a blackjack. Blackjack is one of the easiest casino games to learn and play, which makes it a popular choice for many players.

In blackjack, the goal is to beat the dealer by collecting cards that total 21 or closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. The Ace card is both 1 and 11, so it's important to count cards carefully. If you have more than 21 points, you bust and lose your bet. If the dealer has more than 21 points, they bust and all players who are still in the hand automatically win their bets.

To start playing blackjack, each player places a bet in the betting circle in front of them. The dealer then deals two cards to each player - one face up and one face down - and two cards to themselves, one face up and one face down. The face-up card on the table is called the 'upcard' and the face-down card is called the 'holecard'. 

The players are then allowed to take action according to the following rules:

1)Hit: A player can hit as many times as they want as long as they don't go over 21 points. When they hit, they are given another card from the deck to add to their total.

2)Stand: A player stands when they have a total that they're happy with or when they don't want anymore cards (if their total would go over 21 if they took any more). 
3)Double Down: A player may double their bet if they are dealt an initial two card hand totaling 9, 10 or 11 points with the understanding that they will only get one more card from the deck. 
4)Split: When a player has two cards of equal rank (e.g., two kings), they can split them into two separate hands by placing another bet of equal value next to their original bet. They then play each hand out separately with its own set of dealt cards. After splitting, a player can hit or stand on either hand, but cannot re-split (unless specifically offered by the casino). 
5)Surrender: A player may surrender (only available early in game before dealer draws first card) if they feel like they have no chance of winning; doing so forfeits half their bet amount).


Once all players have either stood or busted (failed to beat dealer), the dealer completes their turn by drawing cards until reaching or exceeding 17 points total; at this point all busting players lose regardless of what their totals were at point of busting. The Dealer must always draw on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more."
