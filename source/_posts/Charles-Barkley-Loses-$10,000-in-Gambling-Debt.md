#  Charles Barkley Loses $10,000 in Gambling Debt

According to a report by <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/charles-barkley-reportedly-lost-10000-in-gambling-debt-to-vegas-casino/">CBS Sports</a>, NBA Hall of Fame player Charles Barkley owes a Las Vegas casino $10,000 after racking up a gambling debt.

The report cites unspecified sources "familiar with the situation" as saying that the money was lost on blackjack and other table games at the casino.

Barkley is no stranger to high-stakes gambling, and has admitted in the past to having lost millions of dollars over the years playing poker, blackjack, and other casino games.

In fact, the former Philadelphia 76ers and Phoenix Suns star has even said that he's "addicted" to gambling and that it's been a major contributor to his financial woes.

In an interview with ESPN in 2009, Barkley said "I'm addicted to gambling...It's just a sickness. I'm trying to get help."

Barkley is not the only high-profile figure to have lost money betting on sports. In October of last year, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban revealed that he had lost $10 million on his investment in pro cycling team owner David Millar's venture capital firm.

#  Charles Barkley: I Can't Quit Gambling

In a recent interview, Charles Barkley stated that he can't quit gambling despite the fact that it's caused him a great deal of personal and professional problems.

"I love gambling," said Barkley. "It's my biggest vice. I've lost millions of dollars over the years, but I can't help myself. I know it's a problem, but I just can't seem to quit."

Barkley says that he started gambling when he was just a teenager and that he's been hooked ever since. He's tried to get help in the past, but has never been able to stick with any program for very long.

"Gambling is like a drug to me," said Barkley. "I know it's hurting me, but I can't stop."

Barkley has had numerous run-ins with the law over his gambling addiction, including several arrests for unpaid debts. He's also lost millions of dollars in endorsement deals due to his addiction.

Despite all of this, Barkley says he has no plans to stop gambling any time soon. "I'm just going to keep on doing what I've been doing," he said. "It's cost me a lot over the years, but I can't help myself."

#  Charles Barkley Lose Another Bet, This Time to Shaq

Charles Barkley is known for his outgoing personality and betting habits. In a recent interview with Shaq, Barkley confirmed that he had lost another bet to the big man, this time involving the placement of NBA Finals bets.

"I have never seen Charles so down," Shaq said of his former teammate and current friend. "He is usually such a jubilant person, but he has been moping around since the Finals ended."

For those who are not familiar with the backstory, Barkley made a friendly wager with Shaq prior to the start of the Finals that whichever team won would get to shave the other's head. The Cavaliers wound up winning in seven games, and Barkley was left with a bald head.

This latest bet was for $100,000 and involved the placement of bets on each game of the series. Shaq says that Barkley admitted to him that he had lost all but two games of the bet and was now down $98,000.

Barkley has not commented on the situation as of yet, but it is clear that he is in a bit of trouble. This is not the first time that he has lost a large sum of money in a bet, and it is likely that it will not be the last.

While some may see this as irresponsible behavior, it is part of what makes Charles Barkley who he is. He is always willing to take risks and have some fun, even if it means putting himself in a bit of jeopardy.

#  Charles Barkley's Gambling Problem is Out of Control

Charles Barkley is one of the most popular NBA personalities on television. He is known as a funny guy with a lot of personality. However, what many people do not know about Charles Barkley is that he has had a serious gambling problem for years.

Barkley's gambling addiction has cost him millions of dollars over the years. In fact, it has gotten so bad that he has even admitted to borrowing money from friends in order to cover his gambling debts. This is a sad state of affairs for someone who makes millions of dollars annually.

In addition to his personal problems, Barkley's gambling addiction has also caused some difficulties for his employers. For example, he was once banned from casinos in Nevada due to his excessive gambling. This ban made it difficult for Barkley to do his job as an announcer for NBA games that were taking place in Las Vegas.

Barkley has tried to get help for his addiction in the past, but it seems like he has not been able to stay away from the casinos for very long. In fact, there have been several occasions where Barkley has shown up on national television looking hungover or tired because he had been up all night gambling.

It is unclear whether or not Barkley will ever be able to overcome his gambling problem. However, it is clear that this issue is costing him a lot of money and causing some major problems in his life. Hopefully, Barkley can get the help he needs and finally put an end to this destructive habit.

#  Charles Barkley Finally Admits He Has a Gambling Problem

Charles Barkley has always been known as a guy with a lot of personality. He is one of the most outspoken athletes in history and is never afraid to speak his mind. This is why it was so surprising when Barkley revealed that he has a gambling problem.

It all started back in 2008 when Barkley was caught on camera betting large sums of money on college basketball games. This raised a lot of eyebrows, but Barkley denied that he had a gambling problem and said that he just likes to gamble for fun.

However, the allegations continued to surface and in 2012, Barkley finally admitted that he has a gambling problem. He said that he has lost millions of dollars over the years due to his addiction and that he has even lied to his wife about how much he gambles.

Barkley has since tried to get help for his addiction, but it hasn't been easy. He has reportedly lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single day while gambling and his wife has threatened to divorce him if he doesn't get help.

Despite his problems, Barkley says that he still enjoys gambling and doesn't plan to stop anytime soon. He knows that he has a problem, but can't seem to break free from the addiction. Hopefully, Barkley will be able to get the help he needs before it's too late.
