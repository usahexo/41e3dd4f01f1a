#  What is the Great 88 game?

The Great 88 game is an online dice game that pits players against each other in a race to roll the highest number possible. The game is based on the classic Yahtzee game, with a few twists that make it more exciting and challenging.

In Great 88, players must roll five dice and try to score as many points as possible by matching different combinations. The first player to reach or exceed 88 points wins the game. If no player reaches 88 points after 13 rounds, the player with the highest score at the end of the game is the winner.

Great 88 can be played by two or more players, and there are a variety of different scoring combinations that can be scored. In addition to straight (5 of a kind), full house (3 of a kind + 2 of a kind), and small straight (4 of a kind), players can also score for pairs, three of a kind, two pairs, and one set (all 5 dice match).

Players can also score using wilds, which allow them to replace any die of their choice with another number. This can be helpful if they need to match a particular combination but don’t have the specific numbers required.

The Great 88 game is a fun and exciting way to test your luck and strategic skills against other players. It’s perfect for any occasion – whether you’re looking for something to do while killing time or want to put some competition into your next party!

#  What are the electric elephant games?

Elephant games are a new type of game that use electric fields to control the movement of elephants on a screen. The idea for the game came about when the team was trying to think of a way to use the electric fields in a fun and interesting way.

The team started by playing around with different ways to move the elephants. They found that they could create an electric field that would push the elephants in a certain direction. They also found that they could create an electric field that would attract the elephants to a certain point.

After playing around with the different electric fields, the team started thinking about ways to use them in a game. They came up with a few different ideas, but eventually decided on a game where you have to guide an elephant through a maze.

The game is played by creating an electric field at the entrance of the maze. The elephant will then be attracted to the field and will start moving through the maze. The player can then change the direction of the field to guide the elephant through the maze.

The team is currently working on finalizing the game and hope to release it soon.
