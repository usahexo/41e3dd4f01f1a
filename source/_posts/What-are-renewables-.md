#  What are renewables? 

Renewables are energy sources that can be replenished relatively quickly. This includes solar, wind, and hydro power. Renewables are a vital part of our energy mix and are key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 

# What is solar power? 
Solar power is the use of the sun’s energy to generate electricity. Solar farms use large arrays of photovoltaic panels to convert sunlight into electricity. Solar is a cost-effective and reliable source of renewable energy and is becoming increasingly popular worldwide. 

# What is wind power? 
Wind power is the use of wind turbines to generate electricity. Wind turbines extract kinetic energy from the wind to turn electric generators. Wind power is a clean and sustainable source of energy and is growing in popularity worldwide. 

# What is hydro power? 
Hydro power uses water from rivers or reservoirs to generate electricity. Hydroelectric dams contain turbines that spin as water flows through them, generating electricity. Hydro power is a reliable and sustainable source of renewable energy.

#  What is the difference between renewable and non-renewables? 

The terms “renewables” and “non-renewables” are often used to describe different types of energy resources. Renewable energy sources come from natural processes that are constantly replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat. Non-renewable energy sources come from finite resources that will eventually run out, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.

Renewables are considered more environmentally friendly because they don’t produce air pollutants or greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Renewables also have the potential to create more jobs than traditional fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are typically less expensive than renewables, but their costs may rise as demand increases and supplies dwindle.

The use of renewables is increasing around the world as technology improves and costs decline. In 2017, renewables accounted for 24% of global electricity generation, up from 18% in 2010. China is the world leader in renewable energy adoption, with over half of its installed electric capacity coming from renewables. The United States ranks second, with nearly a third of its electric capacity from renewables.

#  How do renewables work? 

Renewables are a broad term for any natural resource that can be regenerated, such as solar, wind, water and geothermal energy. Renewables offer an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional forms of energy generation and can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

There are many different types of renewables, each with its own unique benefits and drawbacks. Solar energy is generated by converting sunlight into electrical energy. Solar panels consist of photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into DC voltage. The voltage is then inverted to alternating current (AC) to be used in homes and businesses. Wind turbines use the wind to rotate blades that spin a generator to create electricity.Hydropower uses water pressure to turn turbines and generate electricity, while geothermal energy uses the Earth's natural heat to generate power.

Renewables are growing in popularity due to their environmental benefits and potential cost savings. In some cases, renewables can be more affordable than traditional forms of energy generation. They also emit far fewer pollutants, which can improve air quality and public health. Renewables offer a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, which are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.

There are some drawbacks to using renewables. For example, some forms of renewable energy like solar and wind are intermittent, meaning they are not always available when needed. Additionally, installation costs for some types of renewables can be high. Despite these limitations, renewable energy is quickly becoming a more important part of the global energy mix.

#  Why are renewables important? 

Renewables are important because they provide sustainable energy sources that do not put strain on the environment. They can also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is important for mitigating climate change. Renewables are becoming increasingly affordable and accessible, so they offer a promising solution for meeting our energy needs while protecting the planet.

#  Are renewables the solution to climate change?

Renewables are often seen as the silver bullet for climate change. But are they really the best option? In this article, we take a look at the pros and cons of renewables to see if they really are the answer to climate change.

Pros of renewables

1. Renewables are emissions-free.

This is by far one of the biggest advantages of renewables. Unlike fossil fuels, renewables don’t produce any emissions when they generate electricity. This makes them a much better option for combating climate change.

2. Renewables are abundant and versatile.

Renewables such as solar and wind are abundant and can be used in many different ways. Solar power can be used to generate electricity, heat water or buildings, or run vehicles. And wind power can be used to generate electricity, pump water, or grind grain.

3. Renewables are growing rapidly.

Renewables are growing rapidly all over the world as people become more aware of their benefits. In fact, renewables accounted for more than half of all new generating capacity installed worldwide in 2016! This is good news for combating climate change as it means we are gradually moving away from dirty fuels like coal and gas.

Cons of renewables

1. Renewables can be intermittent.

The sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow! This means that renewable energy sources can sometimes be intermittent, which can cause problems for the grid if not properly managed. For example, if there is a lot of sunshine one day but not much wind, then there could be a shortage of solar power later in the day when demand is high.


2. Renewables can be expensive to install and maintain .
Solar and wind power may seem cheap now, but they will likely become more expensive as they become more popular. Additionally, renewable energy systems often require a lot of maintenance, which can add to the cost over time .
