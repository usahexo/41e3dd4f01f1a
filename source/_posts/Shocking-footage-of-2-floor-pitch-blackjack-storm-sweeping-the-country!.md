#  Shocking footage of 2 floor pitch blackjack storm sweeping the country!

Earlier this week a storm of unprecedented scale swept through the country, wreaking havoc and leaving communities in disarray.

The storm took many people by surprise, with reports of two-floor pitch blackjack sweeping through towns and villages up and down the country.

In footage captured by locals, the sheer scale of the storm can be seen as it moves across the landscape, uprooting trees and lifting roofs off homes.

Many people have been left homeless and without food or shelter in the wake of the storm, and local authorities are struggling to cope with the number of people requiring assistance.

The storm has also caused widespread damage to infrastructure, with roads blocked by fallen trees and power lines brought down by high winds.

Communities are appealing for help from anyone who can offer it, as they begin the long process of rebuilding their lives after this devastating event.

#  What is a 2 floor pitch blackjack storm and why is it so dangerous?

A 2 floor pitch blackjack storm is a rare weather phenomenon that is very dangerous. It is a storm that occurs when two thunderstorms meet and create a very low pressure system. This system can cause very high winds and tornados.

There were reports of 200 mph winds and baseball-sized hail in Raton, New Mexico. 
In Las Cruces, a storm ripped the roof off an apartment complex.
A severe thunderstorm warning was in effect for parts of eastern New Mexico into Texas early Thursday as a fast-moving storm system moved through the area. 

The National Weather Service said the storm system was capable of producing damaging winds, large hail and tornadoes.

 baseball size hail smashed windshields and did major damage to homes and businesses in the small town northeast of Albuquerque known for its production of chile peppers.

#  Are you prepared for a 2 floor pitch blackjack storm?

For the avid blackjack player, a 2 floor pitch blackjack storm can seem like a daunting proposition. However, with a bit of preparation, you can make the most of this exciting variant of the game.

# The basics

In a 2 floor pitch blackjack storm, each player is dealt two cards face down and two cards face up. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either achieving 21 or by taking as close to 21 as possible without going bust. The player can stand, hit or double down on any two cards.

Doubling down allows you to increase your bet by 100% and receive one more card. You can only do this if your first two cards total 10 or 11. If you hit, you will receive another card and your bet will be doubled. If you go over 21, you have busted and lose automatically.

The dealer must also follow specific rules: he must stand on 17 and hit on 16 or less. If the dealer busts, all players still in the game win.

# Playing the game

As in traditional blackjack, it is important to remember that the aim is to beat the dealer's hand, not to get as close to 21 as possible. For example, if you are dealt an Ace and a 4 (total of 5), it might be tempting to hit in the hope of getting 6 or 7 for a total of 12 or 13 respectively. However, if the dealer has a 5 or 6 showing, he is likely to beat your hand even if you hit again. In this case, it would be wiser to stand on 5 rather than risk going bust.

It is also worth remembering that when doubling down, you are only allowed one more card - no matter what happens subsequently. So if you double down on 10 and receive an Ace as your next card, you now have 11 - meaning you cannot hit again!

# Taking advantage of the 2 floor aspect

Although blackjack is always a challenging game, in a 2 floor pitch blackjack storm there are added strategic decisions to be made due to the extra cards available. In particular, being able to see both of the dealer's cards gives players an idea about what he may be holding - particularly if one of his cards is low (6 or less). This can help inform decisions about when to hit and when to stand.

Additionally, because players have more opportunities to draw cards (due to there being two decks), there is more scope for making up combinations that could give them an edge over the dealer - such as drawing 3 cards totalling 21 (known as a "triple").
