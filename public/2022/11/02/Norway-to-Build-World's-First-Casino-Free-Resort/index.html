<p>The project, which is expected to cost around 1.5 billion kroner ($173 million), will be built in the village of Røros, in central Norway. The resort will feature hotels, restaurants, and other tourist amenities, but there will be no slot machines or roulette tables anywhere on the premises.</p>
<p>“This is something totally new and different,” said Minister of Trade and Industry Torbjørn Røe Isaksen in a statement. “We are building a new tourist destination where people can come to experience nature and culture without being tempted by gaming rooms and casinos.”</p>
<p>The idea for the casino-free resort originated with the local community of Røros, which is best known for its historic buildings and surrounding mountains. In recent years, however, the village has seen an increase in tourism from gambling enthusiasts who come to take advantage of its numerous casinos.</p>
<p>“Røros is a fantastic place with rich history and beautiful nature, but it has become known as a place with casinos,” said Mayor Geir Waage in a statement. “We want to change that image and make Røros into a family-friendly tourist attraction where people can come for a nice holiday without having to worry about losing too much money at the casino table.”</p>
<p>The Norwegian government says it expects the new resort to create around 1,000 jobs in Røros and attract around 250,000 tourists each year. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2020 and is expected to be completed by 2024.</p>

The casino has over 430 slot machines and 17 table games. It also has a hotel, spa, and two restaurants. </p>
<p>The casino is about 30 miles from Everett, Norway.</p>
<h1 id="Norway’s-Answer-to-Las-Vegas-A-Casino-Free-Resort"><a href="#Norway’s-Answer-to-Las-Vegas-A-Casino-Free-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Norway’s Answer to Las Vegas: A Casino-Free Resort"></a>Norway’s Answer to Las Vegas: A Casino-Free Resort</h1><p>Norway is known for its gorgeous landscapes and pristine ski resorts, but the country is also home to one unique and casino-free resort: Voringfossen Resort.</p>
<p>The brainchild of Odd Reidar Humlen, a local hotelier and entrepreneur, Voringfossen Resort was designed as an alternative to Las Vegas-style gambling resorts. Rather than gamble away their money in a casino, guests at Voringfossen can enjoy nature hikes, kayaking, and other outdoor activities.</p>
<p>In an interview with the BBC, Humlen explained his motivation for creating the resort: “I didn’t like the idea of people coming to Norway to blow their money in a casino. I wanted to create something that would give them a different experience – something more Norwegian.”</p>
<p>The resort has been a huge success, attracting tourists from all over the world. In addition to its casino-free policy, Voringfossen Resort also offers its guests stunning views of the Voringfoss waterfall and the surrounding mountains.</p>
<h1 id="No-Gambling-in-the-Land-of-the-Midnight-Sun"><a href="#No-Gambling-in-the-Land-of-the-Midnight-Sun" class="headerlink" title="No Gambling in the Land of the Midnight Sun"></a>No Gambling in the Land of the Midnight Sun</h1><p>The pristine state of Alaska, land of the midnight sun, is known for its abundance of outdoor activities and adventures. Fishing, camping, hunting, and hiking are just a few of the things that draw people to this Last Frontier every year. With such a wild and natural landscape, it’s no wonder that some people might be tempted to take their chances in the casinos that have started springing up in recent years.</p>
<p>But there’s one thing you won’t find in Alaska – gambling. It’s not allowed.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this. One is that gambling is seen as a vice that can lead to addiction and ruin families and lives. Another is that gambling takes money away from other businesses, which can hurt the local economy.</p>
<p>Some people might say that these reasons don’t hold water anymore now that casinos are well-regulated and offer responsible gaming options like self-exclusion and accountability measures for problem gamblers. But even with these precautions in place, Alaskans remain opposed to legalizing gambling.</p>
<p>There is one exception to this rule – charitable gaming, which includes bingo, raffles, and pull tabs. These games are allowed because they benefit charity organizations and the community at large. So if you’re looking to try your luck in Alaska, you’ll have to do it the old-fashioned way – by pulling a tab on a can of Coke!</p>
