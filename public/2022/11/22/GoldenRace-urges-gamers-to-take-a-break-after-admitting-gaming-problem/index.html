This problem is not only limited to the young; it affects all age groups.</p>
<p>In a bid to address this growing epidemic, GoldenRace has urged gamers around the world to take a break from gaming and assess their relationship with the activity.</p>

<p>The news follows the admission by GoldenRace that it is struggling to keep up with demand for its virtual reality (VR) racers and retro arcade games online. The company said it is seeing an increase in the number of gamers seeking help to overcome their addiction to gaming.</p>
<p>“We are seeing an increase in the number of people who are addicted to gaming and are seeking help from us,” said Dr Wolfgang Feist, CEO of GoldenRace. “This is why we are urging all gamers to take a break from gaming and assess their relationship with the activity.”</p>
<p>Feist said spending more than two hours per day playing video games can lead to negative consequences such as obesity, social isolation, lack of sleep, and problems in school or work. He added that it was important for gamers to have a healthy balance between their online and offline lives.</p>
<p>In light of these findings, GoldenRace has launched a new campaign called #TakeABreakGG which encourages gamers around the world to take a break from gaming and see how they feel after doing so. To participate in the campaign, gamers simply need to post a selfie on social media holding a sign that says #TakeABreakGG.</p>
<h1 id="Report-GoldenRace-admits-millions-of-gamers-have-a-gaming-problem"><a href="#Report-GoldenRace-admits-millions-of-gamers-have-a-gaming-problem" class="headerlink" title="Report: GoldenRace admits millions of gamers have a gaming problem"></a>Report: GoldenRace admits millions of gamers have a gaming problem</h1><p>The world’s most popular e-sports tournament organiser, GoldenRace, has published a report admitting that millions of gamers around the world have a gaming problem. The report comes as a response to the growing concern over the amount of time people are spending playing video games.</p>
<p>The report, which is based on surveys and interviews with gamers from all over the world, finds that significant numbers of people are playing video games for too long and that this is having a negative impact on their lives. In particular, the report finds that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>37 percent of gamers play video games for more than four hours per day, and 11 percent play for more than eight hours per day;</p>
</li>
<li><p>57 percent of gamers admit that they have skipped social events or family occasions in order to play video games;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two-thirds of players say that they have become irritable or frustrated when they are unable to play video games;</p>
</li>
<li><p>44 percent of players say that their sleep patterns have been disrupted as a result of playing video games; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>One in ten players has developed an addiction to video gaming.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="GoldenRace-changes-its-tune-about-gamers-with-a-gaming-problem"><a href="#GoldenRace-changes-its-tune-about-gamers-with-a-gaming-problem" class="headerlink" title="GoldenRace changes its tune about gamers with a gaming problem"></a>GoldenRace changes its tune about gamers with a gaming problem</h1><p>The CEO of GoldenRace, Lieven Van den Ende, recently stated in an interview that gaming addiction is not a real problem. This flies in the face of what has been considered an industry-wide belief for many years that gaming addiction is a very real and serious problem.</p>
<p>Van den Ende’s statement was made in response to new research from the University of Oxford that suggests that only 2% of gamers are addicted. This research was funded by GoldenRace and conducted by its own researchers.</p>
<p>According to Van den Ende, “The percentage of people with a gaming problem is really small and we cannot just label all gamers as addicts”. He also went on to say that “We have to be careful not to overgeneralize and demonize all gamers”.</p>
<p>This new view on gaming addiction is a radical departure from the industry norm and could signal a change in how game developers approach the issue. It may also cause some players who have been reluctant to seek help for their addiction to reconsider their position.</p>
<h1 id="Study-finds-that-1-in-4-gamers-has-a-gaming-problem"><a href="#Study-finds-that-1-in-4-gamers-has-a-gaming-problem" class="headerlink" title="Study finds that 1 in 4 gamers has a gaming problem"></a>Study finds that 1 in 4 gamers has a gaming problem</h1><p>A recent study published in the journal <i>Clinical Psychological Science</i> has found that one in four gamers may have a problem with gaming. The study surveyed over 4,000 participants and found that 8.5% of men and 3.6% of women showed signs of “gaming disorder.”</p>
<p>Gaming disorder is characterized by an inability to control one’s gaming habits, which can lead to negative consequences in other areas of life such as school or work. Symptoms include prioritizing gaming over other activities, repetitive gaming behavior, feeling irritable or anxious when unable to game, and losing interest in other activities.</p>
<p>The study’s lead author, Dr. Luke Clark, commented on the findings: “These problems are more commonly seen in men than women, and most often in people who start playing games at a young age.”</p>
<p>While the study’s authors note that more research is needed to determine whether or not gaming disorder is an actual mental illness, they advise players who experience any of the symptoms listed above to seek help.</p>
