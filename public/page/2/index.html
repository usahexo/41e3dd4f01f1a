        <h1 id="Norway-to-Build-World’s-First-Casino-Free-Resort"><a href="#Norway-to-Build-World’s-First-Casino-Free-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Norway to Build World’s First Casino-Free Resort"></a>Norway to Build World’s First Casino-Free Resort</h1><p>Norway will soon be home to the world’s first casino-free resort, as the Norwegian government has announced plans to develop a new tourist destination that will not include any gambling facilities.</p>
<p>The project, which is expected to cost around 1.5 billion kroner ($173 million), will be built in the village of Røros, in central Norway. The resort will feature hotels, restaurants, and other tourist amenities, but there will be no slot machines or roulette tables anywhere on the premises.</p>
<p>“This is something totally new and different,” said Minister of Trade and Industry Torbjørn Røe Isaksen in a statement. “We are building a new tourist destination where people can come to experience nature and culture without being tempted by gaming rooms and casinos.”</p>
<p>The idea for the casino-free resort originated with the local community of Røros, which is best known for its historic buildings and surrounding mountains. In recent years, however, the village has seen an increase in tourism from gambling enthusiasts who come to take advantage of its numerous casinos.</p>
<p>“Røros is a fantastic place with rich history and beautiful nature, but it has become known as a place with casinos,” said Mayor Geir Waage in a statement. “We want to change that image and make Røros into a family-friendly tourist attraction where people can come for a nice holiday without having to worry about losing too much money at the casino table.”</p>
<p>The Norwegian government says it expects the new resort to create around 1,000 jobs in Røros and attract around 250,000 tourists each year. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2020 and is expected to be completed by 2024.</p>

The casino has over 430 slot machines and 17 table games. It also has a hotel, spa, and two restaurants. </p>
<p>The casino is about 30 miles from Everett, Norway.</p>
<h1 id="Norway’s-Answer-to-Las-Vegas-A-Casino-Free-Resort"><a href="#Norway’s-Answer-to-Las-Vegas-A-Casino-Free-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Norway’s Answer to Las Vegas: A Casino-Free Resort"></a>Norway’s Answer to Las Vegas: A Casino-Free Resort</h1><p>Norway is known for its gorgeous landscapes and pristine ski resorts, but the country is also home to one unique and casino-free resort: Voringfossen Resort.</p>
<p>The brainchild of Odd Reidar Humlen, a local hotelier and entrepreneur, Voringfossen Resort was designed as an alternative to Las Vegas-style gambling resorts. Rather than gamble away their money in a casino, guests at Voringfossen can enjoy nature hikes, kayaking, and other outdoor activities.</p>
<p>In an interview with the BBC, Humlen explained his motivation for creating the resort: “I didn’t like the idea of people coming to Norway to blow their money in a casino. I wanted to create something that would give them a different experience – something more Norwegian.”</p>
<p>The resort has been a huge success, attracting tourists from all over the world. In addition to its casino-free policy, Voringfossen Resort also offers its guests stunning views of the Voringfoss waterfall and the surrounding mountains.</p>
<h1 id="No-Gambling-in-the-Land-of-the-Midnight-Sun"><a href="#No-Gambling-in-the-Land-of-the-Midnight-Sun" class="headerlink" title="No Gambling in the Land of the Midnight Sun"></a>No Gambling in the Land of the Midnight Sun</h1><p>The pristine state of Alaska, land of the midnight sun, is known for its abundance of outdoor activities and adventures. Fishing, camping, hunting, and hiking are just a few of the things that draw people to this Last Frontier every year. With such a wild and natural landscape, it’s no wonder that some people might be tempted to take their chances in the casinos that have started springing up in recent years.</p>
<p>But there’s one thing you won’t find in Alaska – gambling. It’s not allowed.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this. One is that gambling is seen as a vice that can lead to addiction and ruin families and lives. Another is that gambling takes money away from other businesses, which can hurt the local economy.</p>
<p>Some people might say that these reasons don’t hold water anymore now that casinos are well-regulated and offer responsible gaming options like self-exclusion and accountability measures for problem gamblers. But even with these precautions in place, Alaskans remain opposed to legalizing gambling.</p>
<p>There is one exception to this rule – charitable gaming, which includes bingo, raffles, and pull tabs. These games are allowed because they benefit charity organizations and the community at large. So if you’re looking to try your luck in Alaska, you’ll have to do it the old-fashioned way – by pulling a tab on a can of Coke!</p>

The flooding occurred in the laundry room and resulted in a temporary power outage.</p>
<p>According to a local news outlet, the incident happened at around 9:00 a.m. when the laundry room filled up with water from a burst pipe. Employees were able to shut off the water and call for help.</p>
<p>Las Vegas firefighters responded to the scene and worked to clear the water. They also managed to restore power to the hotel-casino.</p>
<p>While no one was injured during the incident, it’s reported that some guests’ belongings were damaged by the floodwaters.</p>
<p>It’s unclear at this time exactly how much damage was caused by the flooding. Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino has not issued any statements regarding the incident as of yet.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Underwater-Mandalay-Bay-Hotel-Casino-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Casino-Underwater-Mandalay-Bay-Hotel-Casino-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Casino Underwater: Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas"></a>Casino Underwater: Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas</h1><p>The Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas is home to one of the most unique and exciting casino experiences in the world.

With clean-up continuing, it is unclear how this event will impact business moving forward.</p>
<p>The water main break was first detected by hotel staff just before 4am on Wednesday morning. It’s said that the flooding caused damage to at least three rooms on the property, with both the casino and hotel sections seeing leaks throughout. Emergency crews were quickly called to the scene to help pump out the water and assess the damages, which are said to be in the thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>While it’s unclear how this will impact business longterm, it’s likely that Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino will see a decrease in visitors in the short term. This is especially true as news of the break spreads and people become increasingly aware of what happened. In fact, social media is already buzzing with comments from people who are shocked by what took place.</p>
<p>For Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino, this is just another setback in a long line of them. The company has seen its share of controversy in recent years, including a mass shooting that took place on their property last October. With business continually suffering as a result, it’s no wonder that this latest event has some worried about what might happen next.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how things play out for Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino, but for now, it’s safe to say that things aren’t looking good.</p>

<p>At a news conference, Clark County Deputy Fire Chief Jeff Buchanan said that the flooding affected the basement and first floors of the casino, and that cleanup would likely take several days.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing just a lot of water come through the building,” Buchanan said.</p>
<p>Mandalay Bay spokesman Scott Svonkin told The Associated Press that hotel guests were being relocated to other properties within the company’s holdings.</p>
<p>According to The Weather Channel, thunderstorms in the area had dumped more than two inches of rain in less than an hour on Tuesday night.</p>

The hotel’s casino and lobby were flooded, and guests were evacuated to the MGM Grand, about two miles away.</p>
<p>The storm caused widespread power outages and damage throughout the Las Vegas area. More than 10,000 people were without power as of Sunday evening, and schools were canceled on Monday. A number of flights were canceled or delayed at the city’s airport.</p>
<p>Karen DuPlante, a guest at Mandalay Bay, said water was streaming into her room from around the door frame. “It looked like a river running through the hallway and into our room,” she said.</p>
<p>Another guest, Allison Jackson, said she and her husband woke up to water coming into their room from around the door. “We just got our stuff and left as fast as we could,” she said.</p>
<p>Mandalay Bay is owned by MGM Resorts International, which also owns the MGM Grand. Representatives for Mandalay Bay and MGM Resorts did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday evening.</p>

If you’re looking to place bets on Bundesliga matches, you’ll need to deposit funds into a Bundesliga casino account. In this article, we’ll show you how to do that.</p>
<p>The first step is to create an account with a Bundesliga casino. Most of these casinos offer sign-up bonuses, so be sure to take advantage of that. Once your account is set up, you’ll need to add funds to it. This can be done by clicking on the “Deposit” button and selecting your payment method.</p>
<p>There are many different payment methods that can be used for depositing funds into a Bundesliga casino account.

While many people might think of casino games as something that can only be enjoyed in Las Vegas or other gambling hotspots, this is no longer true. Online casinos allow players to bet and play games from the comfort of their own home, and there are now many dedicated Bundesliga casino sites where fans of German football can make bets and enjoy some great gaming action.</p>
<p>One issue that often comes up when it comes to online casinos, however, is how to deposit money into your account. If you’re looking to start playing at a Bundesliga casino site, then read on for our guide on how to deposit Euros into your account.</p>
<p>There are several different ways that you can fund your Bundesliga casino account, but we’ll focus on how to do so using Euros in this guide. The most popular method for doing so is by using a credit or debit card, but there are other options available too. Let’s take a look at each option in more detail.</p>
<p>Credit and Debit Cards</p>
<p>Probably the simplest way to deposit Euros into your Bundesliga casino account is by using a credit or debit card. This method is popular because it’s quick and easy - all you need to do is enter your card details into the site’s banking section and hit the Deposit button. Your funds will then be transferred instantly and you’ll be ready to start playing your favourite casino games.</p>
<p>There are some important things to keep in mind when using a credit or debit card to deposit into an online casino account though. Firstly, not all cards will be accepted by all sites - Visa and Mastercard are the most common types of cards that are accepted, but others like American Express might not be accepted. Secondly, there may be restrictions in place on how much you can deposit at any one time using this method - usually between €100 and €2000 per day depending on the site. Finally, there may also be a small fee charged by the site for using this payment method.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an easy and convenient way to deposit Euros into your Bundesliga casino account then credit or debit cards are definitely worth considering. Just make sure that you check with the specific site beforehand to see if they accept your card type and whether there are any restrictions in place on deposits.</p>
<p>eWallets</p>
<p>Another popular way of depositing Euros into an online casino account is by using an eWallet service. These services work like an online bank account, allowing players to store their funds in a secure online environment. This makes them perfect for use when gambling online as it means players don’t have to share their personal banking information with the site they’re betting with.</p>
<p>There are a number of different eWallet services available, but some of the most popular ones include PayPal, Skrill, Neteller and paysafecard. All of these services allow players to deposit and withdraw Euros quickly and easily, making them a great option for gambling online. As well as being able to use them at Bundesliga casino sites, they can also be used at many other online retailers too so they’re perfect for shopping or funding other online activities too.</p>
<p>One thing to note about eWallets is that not all of them offer instant deposits like credit and debit cards do. In some cases it may take a few hours for your funds to be transferred from your eWallet account into your casino account which may be inconvenient if you want to start playing straightaway. However, once the funds have been transferred they will generally remain available in your account for future use so this shouldn’t be too much of an issue.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for another convenient way of depositing Euros into your Bundesliga casino account then eWallets are definitely worth considering. Just make sure that you familiarise yourself with how each service works before choosing one so that you know what to expect when transferring funds.</p>

The most popular methods are to use a credit or debit card, or to use an eWallet.</p>
<p>When using a credit or debit card, the player will need to enter the card number, expiration date, and the three-digit security code that is on the back of the card. The amount of money that will be deposited will also be entered at this time. This information is then verified by the casino, and the money is deposited into the player’s account.</p>
<p>If players want to use an eWallet, they will need to set up an account with one of the approved providers. Once the account is set up, the player will need to provide their username and password as well as the amount of money they wish to deposit. The funds will then be transferred from the eWallet account into the casino account.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Transfer-Money-into-a-Bundesliga-Casino-Account"><a href="#How-to-Transfer-Money-into-a-Bundesliga-Casino-Account" class="headerlink" title="How to Transfer Money into a Bundesliga Casino Account"></a>How to Transfer Money into a Bundesliga Casino Account</h1><p>When you want to play in a Bundesliga casino, the first thing you need to do is transfer money into your casino account.

        <h1 id="How-to-Have-Fun-with-Casino-Table-Games-–-Part-1"><a href="#How-to-Have-Fun-with-Casino-Table-Games-–-Part-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Have Fun with Casino Table Games – Part 1"></a>How to Have Fun with Casino Table Games – Part 1</h1><p>Casino table games can provide hours of fun and excitement. But, before you can enjoy the games, you need to know how to play them. In this article, we will discuss the basics of some of the most popular casino table games.</p>
<p>Blackjack is a game that is played with cards. The goal of the game is to accumulate 21 points or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player is dealt two cards and the dealer is dealt two cards, one face up and one face down. The player must decide whether to hit (take another card) or stand (keep the current hand). The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going bust (going over 21). Cards 2-10 are worth their face value, while an ace can be worth 1 or 11 depending on what would make the best hand. If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose the hand.</p>
<p>There are many strategies that can be used in blackjack, but one of the simplest is to always hit if the player has under 17 and stand if they have 17 or more. Another thing to keep in mind is that blackjack offers very good odds for players compared to other casino table games.</p>
<p>Roulette is a game that involves betting on which number or colour will come up when the ball stops spinning in the roulette wheel. There are 18 red numbers, 18 black numbers, and 2 green zero slots on the wheel. You can bet on a single number, a range of numbers, black or red, or whether it will be odd or even. You win if your chosen number comes up (or your coloured chip matches the winning colour), and lose if not.</p>
<p>There are many different betting strategies that can be used in roulette - one popular strategy is known as ‘d’Alembert’. This strategy recommends betting an amount equal to your original stake when losing a bet, and reducing your bet by one unit when winning a bet. So for example, if you start with a £5 bet and lose, you would then bet £5 again on your next spin. But if you win then you would only bet £4 on your next spin (£5 less £1). While this strategy does have some success, it’s not guaranteed to make you money in the long run so please do your own research before using it!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Win-at-Casino-Table-Games-–-Part-2"><a href="#How-to-Win-at-Casino-Table-Games-–-Part-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Win at Casino Table Games – Part 2"></a>How to Win at Casino Table Games – Part 2</h1><p>In the first part of this two-part series on how to win at casino table games, we looked at some basic tips for playing blackjack, roulette and craps. In this concluding installment, we’ll provide some more advanced advice on how to maximize your chances of winning when playing these games.</p>
<p>Blackjack</p>
<p>As we mentioned in the previous article, blackjack is a game that can be beaten by following a few simple rules. One of the most important things to remember is to never take insurance – this is simply a sucker’s bet and will only reduce your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Another key rule to remember is to always split pairs of eights or Aces. This increases your chances of forming a strong hand, and can result in some big payouts if you hit 21. Finally, be aware of the dealer’s upcard and try not to bust when they have a low card (2 through 6) showing.</p>
<p>Roulette</p>
<p>In roulette, there are a number of different bets you can make in order to increase your chances of winning. The simplest bet is to wager on a single number, but this pays out at only 35-1 odds. A better strategy is to spread your bets out across several different numbers, which will give you slightly lower payouts but also increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Another key Roulette strategy is to avoid betting on red or black – these bets have an even money payout and offer very poor odds. Instead, focus on betting on the odd or even numbers, or on columns or thirds which offer much better odds.</p>
<p>Craps</p>
<p>When playing craps, there are a number of betting options available that can improve your chances of winning. The most basic bet is the pass line bet, which allows you to place a wager on whether the shooter will roll a seven or eleven on their next turn. This bet has a house edge of 1.41%, making it one of the best options available at the craps table.</p>
<p>Another good bet is the don’t pass line bet, which allows you to bet against the shooter rolling a seven or eleven. This bet has a house edge of 1.36%, so it’s also worth considering if you want to give yourself a better chance of winning. Finally, avoid placing any bets on propositions (such as “boxcars” or “yo 11”), as these have extremely unfavorable odds for players.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Maximize-Your-Fun-and-Wins-Playing-Casino-Table-Games"><a href="#How-to-Maximize-Your-Fun-and-Wins-Playing-Casino-Table-Games" class="headerlink" title="How to Maximize Your Fun and Wins Playing Casino Table Games"></a>How to Maximize Your Fun and Wins Playing Casino Table Games</h1><p>Casino table games can be great fun and also offer the potential for winning big. Just like anything else, though, there are ways to maximize your fun and wins when playing these games. Here are a few tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Do Your Research – Familiarize yourself with the different games and the rules before you start playing. This will help you make better decisions and increase your chances of winning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Start Small – Don’t jump in head first and bet large sums of money. Start small and work your way up as you gain more experience. This will help reduce your risk of losing too much money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose the Right Game – Not all casino table games are created equal. Some offer better odds than others, so it’s important to choose the right one for you. If you’re looking for a high-risk, high-reward game, then go for blackjack or craps. If you’re looking for a game with lower stakes, then try roulette or baccarat instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Play Strategically – There are specific strategies that can be used when playing certain table games in order to give yourself the best chance of winning. Make sure to research these strategies before playing so that you can use them to your advantage.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Practice – Like anything else, practice makes perfect when it comes to casino table games. The more you play, the better you’ll get at knowing what to do and when to do it. This will increase your chances of winning and make the experience more enjoyable overall.</p>

<h1 id="The-Top-5-Fun-Casino-Table-Games-You-Should-Play-Today"><a href="#The-Top-5-Fun-Casino-Table-Games-You-Should-Play-Today" class="headerlink" title="The Top 5 Fun Casino Table Games You Should Play Today"></a>The Top 5 Fun Casino Table Games You Should Play Today</h1><p>Casinos can be a lot of fun, but if you’re not familiar with the games available, it can be tough to know where to start. Here are five of the most popular casino table games, along with some tips on how to play them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Blackjack</li>
</ol>
<p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games for a reason—it’s simple to learn but can be complex to play. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The dealer also tries to get as close to 21 as possible, but if the player gets closer than the dealer, the player wins. There are a number of strategies that players can use in blackjack, so it’s a good game for those who want a bit of challenge.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Poker</li>
</ol>
<p>Poker is another popular casino game that has spawned numerous variants. In general, poker is a card game where players try to make the best five-card hand they can using any combination of their cards and the community cards on the table. There are many different types of poker, so new players should do some research before sitting down at a table. However, all variants of poker share one common rule: bluffing!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Roulette</li>
</ol>
<p>Roulette is a casino classic that’s easy to learn but tricky to master. The game is played with a wheel numbered 0-36 and two betting areas—inside and outside bets. Players bet on either red or black, odd or even, or a particular number (or range of numbers). When the wheel is spun, the ball lands in one of the slots and the winner is determined based on what bets were placed.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Craps</li>
</ol>
<p>Craps is another dice game that can be quite complex for new players. The goal is to predict which number will come up on two dice—a pretty difficult task! In addition to basic rolls, there are also numerous betting options available in craps that can make things more complicated still. But with a little practice, craps can provide hours of entertainment (and hopefully winning!) at the casino table.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Sic Bo</li>
</ol>
<p>Sic Bo is an ancient Chinese dice game that’s now becoming increasingly popular in casinos around the world. The game uses three dice and features several different betting options, including combinations like double odds and triple chances. Sic Bo isn’t as well known as some of the other games on this list, so it might be worth giving it a try if you want something different from your standard casino experience</p>
<h1 id="A-Guide-to-Having-Fun-with-Casino-Table-Games"><a href="#A-Guide-to-Having-Fun-with-Casino-Table-Games" class="headerlink" title="A Guide to Having Fun with Casino Table Games"></a>A Guide to Having Fun with Casino Table Games</h1><p>In the era of online casinos, table games still offer some of the best fun you can have.

This simple game offers plenty of excitement and opportunities for big wins. The basic premise is to bet on where you think the spinning roulette ball will land on the wheel. There are 37 slots on the wheel numbered 1-36 (plus 0 and 00), and players can bet on any number or combination of numbers.</p>
<p>There are also a variety of other betting options available, such as betting on colours (red or black) or whether the number will be even or odd. Roulette offers plenty of flexibility for players who want to make small or large bets, making it one of the most popular table games around.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack"><a href="#Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack"></a>Blackjack</h1><p>Blackjack is another classic casino game that is popular among both beginners and experienced players. The goal is to achieve a hand total of 21 without going over, and players can beat the dealer by either getting closer to 21 than him or her, or by having a higher total than the dealer without going bust.</p>
<p>Blackjack is a great game for strategic thinkers, as successful players need to make decisions based on the cards they are dealt and the dealer’s up card. There are numerous tips and strategies available online if you want to learn more about playing blackjack, but at its core, this is a game that rewards careful decision-making and good judgement.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-variants"><a href="#Poker-variants" class="headerlink" title="Poker variants"></a>Poker variants</h1><p>Poker is another hugely popular casino table game that comes in many different variants.

<p>Texas Hold’em - This is perhaps the most famous poker variant, and it’s typically played with two hole cards and five community cards. Players use their two hole cards plus three community cards to make their best five-card hand.</p>
<p>Omaha - Omaha is similar to Texas Hold’em but uses four hole cards instead of two. This makes for a more complex game with more potential hand combinations.</p>
<p>7 Card Stud - 7 Card Stud is one of the older poker variants and requires players to draw from seven total cards (hence the name). This version tends to favour aggressive players who are comfortable betting big pots.”&gt;7 Card Stud - 7 Card Stud is one of the older poker variants and requires players to draw from seven total cards (hence the name).
