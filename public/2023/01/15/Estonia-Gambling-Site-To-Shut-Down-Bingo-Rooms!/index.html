This comes as a part of the government’s efforts to reduce gambling addiction in the country.</p>
<p>According to officials, the decision was made after a review of the gambling market showed that there was an increase in problem gambling and addiction rates, especially among young people.</p>
<p>The closure of the bingo rooms is expected to have a significant impact on the country’s gambling industry, with many operators likely to face heavy losses. However, officials believe that it is necessary in order to protect vulnerable members of society.</p>
<h1 id="Bingo-Rooms-Pulled-From-Estonia-Gambling-Site"><a href="#Bingo-Rooms-Pulled-From-Estonia-Gambling-Site" class="headerlink" title="Bingo Rooms Pulled From Estonia Gambling Site!"></a>Bingo Rooms Pulled From Estonia Gambling Site!</h1><p>On Tuesday, June 12th, Estonia’s gambling regulator announced that it had pulled the plug on several bingo and casino rooms offered by the country’s biggest online gambling site. This move came as a part of a wider crackdown on unlicensed sites being offered to Estonian players.</p>
<p>This marks the latest in a series of crackdowns by European regulators on unlicensed gambling sites. In March, the UK Gambling Commission announced that it was working with authorities in France and Italy to target nearly two dozen unlicensed gambling sites. At the same time, Italian authorities seized €6 million in assets from an unlicensed online casino.</p>
<p>In Estonia, the gambling regulator identified seven rooms operating without a license, including four bingo rooms and three casino rooms. The regulator said that it had warned the site’s owner, Olympic Casino Eesti AS, about the lack of a license for the rooms back in February. However, Olympic Casino failed to take any action to comply with the regulations.</p>
<p>As a result of this crackdown, Olympic Casino is now prohibited from offering any type of gambling service to Estonian players. This includes both its licensed and unlicensed offerings. In addition, Olympic Casino is required to pay a fine of €100,000 within 30 days.</p>
<p>This move by Estonian regulators is just the latest effort to crack down on unlicensed gambling sites. In addition to targeting specific sites, regulators are also working to improve information sharing among countries so that illegitimate operators can be identified and shut down more quickly.</p>

The company changed its name in February of 2016.</p>
<h1 id="Bingo-Estonia-Gambling-Site-Shuts-Down-Rooms"><a href="#Bingo-Estonia-Gambling-Site-Shuts-Down-Rooms" class="headerlink" title="Bingo Estonia Gambling Site Shuts Down Rooms!"></a>Bingo Estonia Gambling Site Shuts Down Rooms!</h1><p>The popular online bingo site, Bingo Estonia has closed down all of its rooms with immediate effect.</p>
<p>This news was confirmed by a spokesperson for the company who said that the decision had been taken in order to “focus on other areas of the business”.</p>
<p>There has been no explanation as to why this decision has been made, but it is thought that it may have something to do with the recent changes to Estonian gambling laws.</p>
<p>The closure of the rooms will no doubt come as a big disappointment to players who have enjoyed spending time there. However, there is hope that the site will eventually reopen its doors - albeit under a different name.</p>
<p>In the meantime, players can look for other sites offering bingo games or alternatively try their luck at one of Estonia’s many casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Estonia-Gambling-Site-Ends-Bingo-Games-For-Good"><a href="#Estonia-Gambling-Site-Ends-Bingo-Games-For-Good" class="headerlink" title="Estonia Gambling Site Ends Bingo Games For Good!"></a>Estonia Gambling Site Ends Bingo Games For Good!</h1><p>The gambling site, EstOnline has announced that it will be ending all bingo games starting from May 11th 2019. In a statement released by the company, it indicated that the decision to end the bingo games was reached after careful consideration and deliberation. The statement also said that the company is grateful to its players for their support over the years.</p>
<p>Bingo has been one of the main attractions on EstOnline and its closure will come as a big disappointment to many players. However, there is still plenty of other games available on the site including slots, roulette, blackjack and poker. So, there is still something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>EstOnline was founded in Estonia in 2009 and offers a range of casino games as well as bingo. The site is licenced by the UK Gambling Commission and is regulated by strict standards ensuring fairness and accountability.</p>
<p>Players who have funded their accounts with EstOnline will be able to withdraw their funds using standard payment methods such as bank transfer, Skrill or Neteller. There is also an option to receive payments in Bitcoin.</p>
